# My angular first App 

Usign the best Online IDE powered by Visual Studio Code
[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vkwfzw)

The idea is go learning and practice with a simple but powerfully.

An important thinng to mentioned is that in the road I coding automated test to check the expected behavoir of the app, this usign Screenplay Framework with Java and Cucumber. If you need to kwon more about testing and the screenplay framework checkout my testing repos, you only need:

- JAVA JDK and JRE
- Gradle installed locally
- I recomend Intellij IDEA
- Cucumber plugin for intellij

Angular is a good frontend framework, that make easy a lot of works in the side of the client.

In next days when I growing up with angular I think to start to make Unit test and I complement this with the automated tests that I already mentioned.

### As well I want to go more deep:

1. Implement unit test for the begginer project.
2. Implement end to end (E2E) tests.
3. Build an a simple API rest to consume it from the front but test this API as well wit automation tests.

In little bit words, This project going to have all neccesary to go to production.

## The initial apparience of the app
